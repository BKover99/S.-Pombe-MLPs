# S.-Pombe-MLPs
This repository contains all the code to produce the findings in my Master's thesis and the subsequent research article.

The structure of the repository is as follows:

### Bence folder
Contains all the code to reproduce the analysis and plots found in the thesis. All code written by Bence Kover, with early input from co-author Celeste Cohen.

### yeastmlptrial
Contains code under development for https://github.com/BKover99/yeastmlp. This software package allows fast quantification of MLP formation, including the analysis of the adhesion and flocculation assays from our work.e

### Internal data
Contains all of our collected experimental data.

### External data
Data used in the thesis from other publications.

### Supplementary data
Excel spreadsheet with multiple pages to include all the processed data which might be of interest for other researchers. (Those interested in the raw data can still find everything in the other folders!)
