# S.-Pombe-MLPs
This repository contains all the code to produce the findings in Kövér et al.: Genetic and environmental determinants of multicellular-like phenotypes in fission yeast

This github repo contains all code and smaller data files. To access the data please clone the repository. For the full repository with larger data files please visit Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25750980).

The structure of the repository is as follows:

### Bence folder
Contains all the code to reproduce the analysis and plots found in the thesis. All code written by Bence Kover, with early input from co-author Celeste Cohen.

### Ben folder
Contains some code for analysis of data produced during the revision process. These include growth curve analysis and cropping microscopy images.

### Internal data
Contains all of our collected experimental data for the initial submission and pre-print.

### revisions_data
Contains the collected experimental data during the revision process.

### External data
Data used in the thesis from other publications.

### Supplementary data
Excel spreadsheet with multiple pages to include all the processed data which might be of interest for other researchers. (Those interested in the raw data can still find everything in the other folders!)
